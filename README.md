**Makefile**
------------------------


----------


**Introduction**
An example of a make file workflow.

**Features**


 - make_example/read_directory that reads the path to the folder where the 
current working directory is a sub-directory and saves it in a file.
 
 - make_example/read_files.sh that reads directories from a file and stores the
 filepath of files in these directories in another file.

 - count_sequences.sh that counts the occurrence of a sequence in all files 
listed in an input file and outputs the number of occurances plus the filepath
to another file.
 - make_example/echo_count.sh that takes a file that contains filepaths and 
the number of occurances of the word echo in them. It then prints the file
paths with the coresponding count of 'echos' and finally printing the total.
